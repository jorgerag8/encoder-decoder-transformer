# Abstract

In the era of rapid development of machine learning techniques, they are being applied in different tasks solving different problems, 
in- cluding in behavior science and neuroscience. The data used was obtained from a study investigating continuous decision-making in mice, 
recording both timestamped behavioral information and concurrent neuronal activity. Given the nature of both sequences, 
an encoder-decoder transformer model was implemented to explore the possibility of using the neural activity of mice to predict 
its lever-held-down duration. Three models were tested, each to perform binary classification, multi-class classification, 
and sequence-to-sequence translation on neural activity and behavioral data collected from mice performing lever-held-down tasks. 
The three modelsâ€™ performances indeed exceed our expectations considering the input is noisy neural data. 
Indicating that this type of model can be used to predict mice activity given neural activity information.
